				<h1>Genres</h1>
					<p>Dance is a beautiful physical art that allows human beings to express their feelings, dance can help tell a story and can show true
					emotion in a performance. There are many different types of genres of dance such as, <a href="ballet.html">Ballet</a>, <a href="hipHop.html">Hip Hop</a>,
					<a href="ballroom.html">Ballroom</a> and <a href="tap.html">Tap</a>. Dance can be performed for fun, in front of audiences and competitions.</p>
					<p>(1) Before music and dance were paired together to help develop the different styles of dance to be recognised, dance would get presented 
					independently through its own companion. An example of a type of dance that provided its own accompaniment is tap dance.</p>
					<p>The main element of dance is its choreography, as that is what makes and expresses the dance moves. Choreography involves different types of 
					movements and those movements are perfected and implemented into a dance technique such as ballet. However, there are different types of choreography such as
					improvisation and planned. Improvisation is when the choreographer provides the dancer with guidelines for a movement and form. Planned choreography is when
					the choreographer dictates and shows the dancers the movements.</p>
					
					<p>Arden once quoted, (2) "Dance isn't something that can be explained in words. It has to be danced."</p>
